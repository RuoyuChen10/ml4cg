# If there is any situation that you don't know how many rows you want but are sure of the number of columns, 
# then you can specify this with a -1. (Note that you can extend this to tensors with more dimensions. 
# Only one of the axis value can be -1). This is a way of telling the library: 
# "give me a tensor that has these many columns and you compute the appropriate number of rows 
# that is necessary to make this happen."
